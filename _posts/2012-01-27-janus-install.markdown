	<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">A</span>ll the cool kids at work have switched to Janus/VIM from Eclipse.  I got a new computer today so I decided to try it out.  I ran into some issue installing from the default script.  I put my notes in a gist just in case I have to redo it later.</p><p>So far so good, I prefer VIM to any text editor as I have a systems background I am fairly comfortable there.  BUT, our app uses a ton of API calls and I hope debugging will work out well.  We will find out in the next few days.</p>
