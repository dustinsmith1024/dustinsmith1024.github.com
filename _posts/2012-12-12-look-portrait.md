<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">I</span> just finished up some work for a great photographer in Omaha.  Check it out at <a href="http://lookportrait.com/">Look Portrait</a>
</p>

I used a couple of new tools this time around. First was Middleman for making a static site but with the advantages of reusable templates, SASS/LESS, and a suite of other features.

For the grids system I tried out Bourbon Neat.  Neat is a sweet little fluid grid system developed by some guys at Thoughtbot.  It is a different take on grids than I used before and I really liked it.  The fluid grids just work and are easily configurable.

I'll post some updates soon, been lazy lately/busy with a baby.  [Baby Dillon pics :-)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dustinsmith1024/sets/72157632235952514/)
