<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">P</span>laying around with the ESPN API a bit lately. I made a quick Rails app to pull in all the NBA teams and display the headlines for each team. Check it out at <a href="http://three-point-news.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

The API is pretty cool and is progressively getting better. The problem is a lot of the cool stuff is only available to 'partners'.  Hopefully they open it up a bit more in the future.
