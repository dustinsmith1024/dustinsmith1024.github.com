	<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">A</span>t work the other day we hit 100,000 users.  It was pretty exciting as it is by far the largest site I have ever worked on.  We also had a hacknight that night at work and was looking to do something with the theme of user and their avatars.  So I started playing around with something on JSBin to see if I could make one of those mashups of small pictures creating a larger picture.  This isn't perfect but it shows some cool use cases for some new CSS3 properties.</p>
