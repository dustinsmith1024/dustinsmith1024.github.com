  <div><p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">D</span>akota Dunes, SD was my home for the last week.  This is where my parents and a number of friends live.  The place is about to flood throughout June because of abnormal amounts of rain and snow in Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and anywhere else on the Missouri river.
</p>
<p>
I am finally back in Kansas City now but feel bad to leave.  There are 2,000+ people being evacuated from the area currently.  The government has told them all that they might be displaced for 2 or more months.
</p>
<p>
There are going to be other areas affected by this flood not just the Dune's. There is going to be a long term impact from this not just the flooding and housing impact.  The whole Siouxland (SUX) area will have a huge economic impact.

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
June 14, 2011 - Currently my parents and all the Dunes residents are still displaced from their homes.  However, there is no damage to my parents home yet.  Many of the homes right on the river are having issues, but the majority are still okay.  I am not sure how long this will last but currently the levees are holding.  There is no telling if groundwater is in the basement yet.

I will update again in when we have more news.  Check out the pictures section or <a href="http://www.SiouxCityJournal.com">SiouxCityJournal.com</a> for pictures.
