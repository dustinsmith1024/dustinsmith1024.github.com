<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">R</span>esponsive design is in full effect these days.  It's a easy way to make sure you site looks good for everyone.  Since all of my personal projects are responsive I wanted a way to quickly check my sites.  So, I made a little app to send a set screenshots to any email address.

It's fairly simple right now, but I have some plans to make it better.  I want to add the ability for developers to post to site after a deployment.  This will allow a quick sanity check of the site and prove to whoever that the feature(s) were released.
